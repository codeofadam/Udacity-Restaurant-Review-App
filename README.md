# [Udacity Restaurant Reviews App](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1)

For this project, I converted a static webpage to a mobile-ready web application. The original static design lacked accessibility and responsiveness has been converted into a responsive design with accessibility to ensure correct screen reader use. I have added a service worker help cache the content for offline use. 

## Overview

The started code is forked from [Udacity's](https://github.com/udacity/mws-restaurant-stage-1) github.
The project work has improved below three areas:
- Responsive Desig,
- Accessibility
- Offline Use.

## How to launch the app locally?
To run this example you'll need to use a local server. The steps below will help you to use Python, which is how I ran it:

* 1 - Download the GitHub zip file or clone the repository onto your local workstation:
    ```
    https://github.com/codeofadam/Udacity-Restaurant-Review-App
    ```
* 2 - Using Terminal enter into project directory
* 3 - In a terminal, check the version of Python you have: `python -V`.
	- 3.a If you have Python version 2, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.)
	- 3.b For Python version 3, you can use `python -m http.server 8000`.
* 4 -- With your server running, visit the site in your browser: `http://localhost:8000`
